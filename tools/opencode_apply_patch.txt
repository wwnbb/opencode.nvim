Use the `apply_patch` tool to edit files. Your patch language is a stripped-down, file-oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. You can think of it as a high-level envelope:

*** Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
*** End Patch

Within that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.
You MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.
Each operation starts with one of three headers:

*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).
*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).

Example patch:

```
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: hello.txt
+Hello world
*** Update File: src/app.py
*** Move to: src/main.py
@@ def greet():
-print("Hi")
+print("Hello, world!")
*** Delete File: obsolete.txt
*** End Patch
```

It is important to remember:

- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)
- You must prefix new lines with `+` even when creating a new file
 - When updating files, include the original lines you are changing exactly as they appear (preserve whitespace) so the verifier can match context.
 - Hunk headers should use unified-diff style with line ranges, for example: `@@ -12,3 +12,3 @@` followed by the exact original and replacement lines. If you prefer a single-line replacement, you may provide just the original line prefixed with `-` and the new line prefixed with `+` without a numeric header, but the original text must match exactly.
 - If a hunk fails because context didn't match, run `Read` on the file and copy surrounding lines to ensure exact match before retrying.
